## Data Analysis and Visualization for Social Scientists

The goal of the workshop is to teach best practices for data analysis and visualization with R. R is commonly used in many scientific disciplines for statistical analysis and for its powerful data science packages. Known as `tidyverse`, a collection of R packages allows novice programmers to write clear, concise and powerful code for data analysis and visualization. In this workshop, you will gain hands-on experience on using some of the tidyverse packages to analyze a data set and plot publication-quality graphs. No prior knowledge of the skills or tools is necessary. You should bring a laptop with R and RStudio installed.

### Learning outcomes:

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

- navigate through a project folder using RStudio;
- install different R packages and learn how to use specific functions from a package;
- read data files with R;
- inspect, clean and modify data sets;
- apply a simple statistical analysis;
- generate publication-quality graphs.


*Couldn't install R or RStudio?*

- First, you should install R. See [the instructions](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/).
- Then, you need to install RStudio: Click [here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), choose RStudio Desktop (Open Source License), and then simply follow the instructions. Default options should be just fine!
